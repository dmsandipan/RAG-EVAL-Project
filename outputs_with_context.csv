Despite his injuries, Inglis refused to retire from the battle but remained with the regimental colours, encouraging his men with the words ""Die hard 57th, die hard!"" as they came under intense pressure from a French attack.

 'Christopher Francis ""Chris"" Tate is a fictional character from the British ITV soap opera, ""Emmerdale"", played by Peter Amory. The character made his first appearance on 14 November 1989, when he arrived in the village alongside the rest of the Tate family - his father Frank, stepmother Kim and younger sister, Zoe. Initially, Chris was a good man who ran his business fairly, but was left permanently resentful of his life when he was maimed in a plane crash in 1993, which left him paralyzed from the waist down. The character then became much more jaded and bitter, often using his intelligence and assets to exact revenge on those he perceived to have hurt him. The resulting disabilities he was left with made him realize that his wife Kathy only remained with him to fulfill the role of his carer, leading to their divorce. He went on to marry Rachel Hughes in 1995, but his growing lust for money and indifference for everyone else\'s feelings lead to marital breakdown and divorce. Chris then married former prostitute Charity Dingle in 2001, despite a 12-year age gap and the disapproval of Zoe, but Charity\'s selfishness and cheating behaviour ultimately lead to the deterioration of their relationship. Chris soon learned he had an inoperable brain tumour, and rather than wait to die, decided to take revenge on Charity. After ensuring Charity would be left with nothing, he made his final appearance on 18 September 2003, when he committed suicide so as to frame her for his murder. Although Charity claimed she was sorry, Chris\'s last words consisted of a tirade of insults towards her, before the poison he had taken killed him.'
